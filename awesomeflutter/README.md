organise the flutter code in different class instead of runApp

We can create the seperate file with extension .dart and use this for organise the code.

Suppose we create class first_screen.dart and in this class we take following line
class FirstScreen extends StatelessWidget

then it means the we can import this class anywhere in our code and this class will return Widget

functions:-

return_type function_name()


to print the variable we can use $variable_name
